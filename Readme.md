## Description ##

Every binary output comes out into bin/ folder and the data comes out to be data/ folder.

For this version, you can only use "sampler" application to generate the samples.

Use of the "sampler" app :

	./sampler [output_file] [vertices_N] [start_weight] [weight]

The sample output of "output_file" should be formatted like :

	[number_of_vertices]\t[number_of_edges]
	[edge#1(start\tend\tweight)]
	[edge#2]
	[edge#3]
	...
	...
	...
	[edge#N]
